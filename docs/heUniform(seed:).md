# heUniform(seed:)

Returns a function that creates a tensor by performing He (Kaiming) uniform initialization for
the specified shape, randomly sampling scalar values from a uniform distribution between `-limit`
and `limit`, generated by the default random number generator, where limit is
`sqrt(6 / fanIn)`, and `fanIn` represents the number of input features multiplied by the
receptive field, if present.

``` swift
public func heUniform<Scalar: TensorFlowFloatingPoint>(seed: TensorFlowSeed = Context.local.randomSeed) -> ParameterInitializer<Scalar>
```
