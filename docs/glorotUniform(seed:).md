# glorotUniform(seed:)

Returns a function that creates a tensor by performing Glorot (Xavier) uniform initialization
for the specified shape, randomly sampling scalar values from a uniform distribution between
`-limit` and `limit`, generated by the default random number generator, where limit is
`sqrt(6 / (fanIn + fanOut))`, and `fanIn`/`fanOut` represent the number of input and output
features multiplied by the receptive field, if present.

``` swift
public func glorotUniform<Scalar: TensorFlowFloatingPoint>(seed: TensorFlowSeed = Context.local.randomSeed) -> ParameterInitializer<Scalar>
```
